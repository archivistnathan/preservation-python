# Welcome to Preservation Python

_Preservation Python is a snake-type game where the player controls a continually shrinking python (though you might not alway notice!), a metaphor for obsolescence and data loss. The python must ingest, pun intended, content and preservation information while avoiding elements that accelerate data loss. If the python survives a certain length of time, the required elements will change into preservation actions needed to maintain continued access._

_The game is meant to introduce the elements of an OAIS Archival Information Package to beginners in a fun and interactive way, as well as to present digital preservation as a continuous activity. The fast-paced nature of a snake game also encourages the player to make decisions on which elements they prefer to prioritise._

_The game is a product of the Bits and Bots study group (https://github.com/Lotte-W/Bits-and-Bots-study-group)._

## Ingest Preservation Information and avoid preservation failure!

### Capture your Data Object and Accompanying PDIs

- Data Object 

- Provenance 

- Fixity 

- Context 

- Reference 

- Access Rights 

- Representation Information 

- Packaging Information 


### Avoid elements that could lead to data loss

- Malware 

- Obsolescence 

- Accidental Deletion 

- Hardware Malfunction 

- Software Bugs 

- Legal Issues 

- Lack of Organisational Commitment


### Keep it going and ensure continued accessibility over time!

- Media Refreshment 

- Technology Watch 

- Format Migration 

- Emulation 

- Backups

_Each PDI or preservation action increases your score. Obsolescence and data loss will halve your current score._

__The game ends when your score goes below 1.__

## Installations

Download preservation.py and the iamges folder.

Make sure you have Python3 installed. Add pygame using pip3.

Navigate to the folder containing preservation.py and run with Python3.

Enjoy!
