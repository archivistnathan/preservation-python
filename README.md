# Welcome to Preservation Python

## Ingest Preservation Information and avoid preservation failure!

### Capture your Data Object and Accompanying PDIs

- Data Object 

- Provenance 

- Fixity 

- Context 

- Reference 

- Access Rights 

- Representation Information 

- Packaging Information 


### Avoid elements that could lead to data loss

- Malware 

- Obsolescence 

- Accidental Deletion 

- Hardware Malfunction 

- Software Bugs 

- Legal Issues 

- Lack of Organisational Commitment


### Keep it going and ensure continued accessibility over time!

- Media Refreshment 

- Technology Watch 

- Format Migration 

- Emulation 

- Backups

* Each PDI or preservation action increases your score. Obsolescence and data loss will halve your current score. *
## The game ends when your score goes below 1.


Preservation Python is a snake-type game where the player controls a continually shrinking python, a metaphor for obsolescence and data loss. The python must ingest, pun intended, content and preservation information while avoiding elements that accelerate data loss. If the python survives a certain length of time, the required elements will change into preservation actions needed to maintain continued access.
The game is meant to introduce the elements of an OAIS Archival Information Package to beginners in a fun and interactive way, as well as to present digital preservation as a continuous activity. The fast-paced nature of a snake game also encourages the player to make decisions on which elements they prefer to prioritise.
The game is a product of the Bits and Bots study group (https://github.com/Lotte-W/Bits-and-Bots-study- group).
